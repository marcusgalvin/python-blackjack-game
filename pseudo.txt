first start off with a deck of cards... giving each card a point, 1-11 and storing 4 values = to 10 for the face cards

deal two cards to the user

deal two cards to the dealer but one must be not visable to the user

after all cards have been delt, ask the user if they wish to stay or hit

if they wish to hit, deal them another random card from the desk, then ask the stay/hot question again unthil they stay or bust

user will bust if the total amt of their cards is over 21

-----------

if users cards are not over 21 and they choose to stay

the dealer must "hit" until they have 17 or more total values
if the dealer hits over 21, they bust
